# Python Calculator Program
This is a simple and interactive command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. The program also includes error handling to prevent division by zero.

# Features
Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/) with error handling: Divides the first number by the second, with a check for division by zero.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
Exponentiation () (Power)**: Raises the first number to the power of the second.
Exit Option: Exits the program when the user chooses option 7.
# How to Use
Run the Python program.
Choose the operation by pressing the corresponding number (1-7).
Enter two numbers when prompted.
The result of the operation will be displayed.
To exit the program, press 7.

# Code Structure
The Calculator class defines six methods (add, sub, mul, division, mod, pow) for different arithmetic operations.
The Calculator_code function contains the user interface, where users can choose an operation and input numbers.
The program loops until the user selects option 7 to exit.
